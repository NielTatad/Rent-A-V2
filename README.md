# Rent-A-V2

This is a test repository where I create AWS services—especially EC2 instances—using Terraform. The purpose of this repo is to experiment with and demonstrate infrastructure as code (IaC) practices on AWS, focusing on automating the provisioning and management of cloud resources.

## Features
- Terraform configuration for AWS EC2 (free tier eligible)
- Modular structure for reusable infrastructure code
- GitHub Actions CI for validating Terraform code on pull requests

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your AWS credentials.
3. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to provision resources.
